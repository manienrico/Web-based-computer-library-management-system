# Web-based-computer-library-management-system
A basic management system whose system users inclue administators, staff and a manager.

In this project, i had a test of my Fullstack capabilities with react.js for the frontend and node.js and mySql for the backend. And my conclusion was that my basic backend skills are alittle greater than my frontend skills. So i rested this project to perfect my frontend skills and then have a go t it again.
